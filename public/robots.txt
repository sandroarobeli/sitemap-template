# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts
# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!
# and Google. By telling these "robots" where not to go on your site,
# you save bandwidth and server resources.

# This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host:

# Ignored: http://example.com/site/robots.txt
# IMPORTANT NOTES BELOW:
# Theoretically, you could disallow a page, but it could still end up in the index.
# That’s why you need the Noindex directive. It works with the disallow so bots don’t visit or index certain pages
# Disallow: /Misc/
# Noindex: /Misc/
# Same end goal, different format <a href=”http://www.website.com/” rel=”nofollow”>Link Text</a>
